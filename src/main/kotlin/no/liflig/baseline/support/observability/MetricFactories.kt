/**
 * This file is a collection of all OpenTelemetry metrics factories, used to create
 * counters and gauges etc.
 *
 * The metrics' units follow UCUM http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html.
 * This means that unit is case sensitive, and can be things like: 1, s, ms, kB, B, mbps, and so on.
 *
 * Units can also contain an annotation, which is a word in brackets: "{events}", "{failures}", "%{ratio}", "s{latency}", and so on.
 * An annotation without a unit is the default unit "1".
 * "{events}" means "unit of 1, with annotation events".
 *
 * Metric names should use lowercase and underscores: my_metric_name.
 *
 * Descriptions can be anything, and explains the metric for a human.
